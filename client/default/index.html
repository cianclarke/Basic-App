<!-- 
The client directory contains all files which may be included when an app is 
built.

The client directory is divided into "packages" - incremental units of 
functionality and configuration.

Every app will always include the files within the "default" package - 
represented by the path /client/default/ - i.e. the directory containing this 
file.

New packages can be defined by creating additional directories within the client
directory. To associate a particular package with a destination (iPhone, iPad, 
Android etc), add the "package" (i.e. directory) name to the packages field 
within the configuration section of the studio. 

Multiple packages can be associated with a destination by adding multiple package
names - separated by spaces - to the packages field in the configuration section.
If multiple packages are defined, the packages are applied incrementally - i.e. 
if the same file exists in multiple packages the order that the packages are 
listed will determine which package the file is pulled from. The package names 
are listed in order of significance with the most significant package name listed 
first. 

The contents of the default package are always included as the least significant 
package.
